1. File Creation
echo "Sample data for link testing." > ~/sample_data.txt

Explanation: Creates a file with sample text.


2. Hard Link Creation
ln ~/sample_data.txt ~/sample_hard.txt

Explanation: Creates a hard link pointing to the same inode.


3. Symbolic Link Creation
ln -s ~/sample_data.txt ~/sample_soft.txt

Explanation: Creates a symbolic link referencing the original file path.


4. Inode Verification
ls -i sample_data.txt sample_hard.txt sample_soft.txt

Explanation: Displays inode numbers for all three files.


5. Inode Analysis
Explanation: sample_data.txt and sample_hard.txt share the same inode because hard links point to the same data block, while symbolic links have different inodes.

6. File Metadata Inspection
ls -l sample_data.txt
Explanation: Shows permissions, size, ownership, and timestamps.


7. Disk Usage Check
du -sh ~
Explanation: Displays total disk usage of the home directory.


8. File Size Overview
ls -lh ~

Explanation: Lists file sizes in human-readable format.


9. Link Deletion Test
rm sample_soft.txt
ls sample_data.txt

Explanation: Removing the symbolic link does not affect the original file.


10. Disk Utility Demonstration
du -h --max-depth=1 ~
df -h

Explanation: du shows directory-wise disk usage, and df displays filesystem space usage.
